# Overview

Are you struggling with these challenges when issuing tokens?

- **Lack of blockchain knowledge**
- **High gas costs**
- **Slow processing times**

Managing tokens with no current value on web3 can be inefficient and expensive in terms of gas fees. It's like storing your child's play money in a high-security vault.

## How it works

GasFree Token is an API service designed to provide a temporary and hassle-free solution for managing and distributing tokens for DAOs and other token holders who have not yet deployed their ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. Here is how GasFree Token works:

1. **Generate Temporary Tokens** - Users can generate temporary tokens using GasFree Token's **Mint API**. These tokens can be used to distribute to contributors or other parties who need to hold tokens temporarily.

2. **Manage Token Balances** - Users can manage their token balances using GasFree Token's APIs, which include **Transfer**, **Burn**, and **BalanceOf** functions. Token balances are stored securely in the cloud, eliminating the need for manual management of token balances.

3. **Migrate to ERC20** - When users are ready to deploy their ERC20 tokens on the mainnet, they can use GasFree Token's **Migrate API** to migrate their temporary tokens to the new ERC20 contract. The equivalent amount of tokens will be automatically minted to the holders' wallets.

GasFree Token provides a convenient and cost-effective way for DAOs and other token holders to manage and distribute their tokens without incurring gas fees or manual management tasks. The cloud-based token balance management and automatic token migration features make it easy to manage and issue tokens, while the basic APIs allow for simple token transfers, burning, and balance checking. Overall, GasFree Token simplifies the token management and issuance process for DAOs and other token holders, providing a cost-effective and convenient solution to manage and distribute their tokens.

# Overview

Have you ever faced these problems when issuing tokens?

- **No knowledge of blockchain**
- **Gas costs**
- **Processing is slow**

It costs a lot of gas and is clearly over-engineered to handle tokens that have no value yet on web3. It is like keeping your children's banknotes in a vault.

## Gas Free Token

Gas Free Token is a token that can be used without the need to pay for gas.

Gas Free Token is a temporary Token that is used on web2. Later, when the token starts to gain value, it can be transferred to web3.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

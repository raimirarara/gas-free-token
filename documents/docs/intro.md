# Overview

Are you struggling with these challenges when issuing tokens?

- **Lack of blockchain knowledge**
- **High gas costs**
- **Slow processing times**

Managing tokens with no current value on web3 can be inefficient and expensive in terms of gas fees. It's like storing your child's play money in a high-security vault.

## Introducing Gas-Free Tokens

Gas-Free Tokens are designed for use without the need to pay for gas fees. These temporary tokens can be utilized on web2 until they gain value, at which point they can be transferred to web3.

### What you'll need

To get started with Gas-Free Tokens, you will need:

- For frontend usage or to follow a tutorial:
  - [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)
